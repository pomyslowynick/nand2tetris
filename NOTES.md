Started on the course, working on project 1 at the moment.
I have in the past completed parts of the course, to my astonishment I still remember parts of this assignment. It seems so much easier after few years and exposure to professional dev work.

Getting good hang of the material, proceeding actually quite quickly through the course. It's funny how I struggle with exactly same problems now after 2-3 years, like the usage of DFF in Bit implementation. I remember what I struggled with, but not the solutions, or only vaguelly. I am approaching week 4, which is the one at which I stopped the last time. Can't wait to learn more!

BTW: I am quite impressed that I made it so far few years ago with absurdly less knowledge about computing systems.

I loved the notion of the universal machine introduced by Turing, haven't really thought about it before. It makes sense that computers in prnciple have the capability to calculate anything that a Turing machine can.

In video 4.7 there is a great quote from Donald Knuth that I haven't seen before. It boils down to "code as if you were explaining what you are doing to a fellow programmer".
In Hack machine language there is only one type of variable, 16 bits of data.

Pointers seem quite easy from the hardware perspective, or maybe it's because I have already learnt about them in C?

Von Neumann architecture.
Universal Turing Machine.
