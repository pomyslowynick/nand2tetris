Started on the course, working on project 1 at the moment.
I have in the past completed parts of the course, to my astonishment I still remember parts of this assignment. It seems so much easier after few years and exposure to professional dev work.

Getting good hang of the material, proceeding actually quite quickly through the course. It's funny how I struggle with exactly same problems now after 2-3 years, like the usage of DFF in Bit implementation. I remember what I struggled with, but not the solutions, or only vaguelly. I am approaching week 4, which is the one at which I stopped the last time. Can't wait to learn more!

BTW: I am quite impressed that I made it so far few years ago with absurdly less knowledge about computing systems.
